# Timepon

**AI-assisted development hygiene product that tracks file creation and metadata.**

Keep your LLM's favourite passtime of document creation clean and managable, even during the heaviest vibe flow. Timepon automatically tracks new files, extracts metadata, and makes file history visible to both you and your AI so you can keep things clean, clear and tidy

---

## What It Does

- Watches your workspace for new files
- Automatically extracts metadata: creation time, summary, tags
- Stores everything in `_timepon.yaml` as a readable file tree
- Provides MCP tools so AI can query your file history
- Runs silently in the background

## Quick Start

**Get running in 5 minutes:**

1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   cd mcp-server
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure Cursor (run the helper script):
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup-config.ps1
   ```

3. Restart Cursor

4. Test it - ask your AI:
   ```
   Show me all files using timepon
   ```

That's it. See [`QUICK_START.md`](QUICK_START.md) for more details.

## How It Works

Timepon is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with Cursor IDE. It watches your workspace for new files and automatically:

1. **Tracks Creation** - Records when files are created
2. **Generates Summary** - Extracts heading (markdown) or first comment (code)
3. **Auto-Tags** - Assigns up to 3 tags based on extension, type, and content
4. **Stores in YAML** - Human-readable tree structure in `_timepon.yaml`

### File Filtering

Create a `.tponignore` file in your project root to control which files are tracked. It supports `.gitignore` syntax:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# Your custom patterns...
```

The server automatically reads both `.tponignore` and `.gitignore` files, merging their patterns to determine what to ignore.

Your AI can then query this data to answer questions like:
- "What files were created today?"
- "Show me all API-related files"
- "Find files tagged with 'schema'"

---

## Why Timepon?

When developing with AI assistance, documentation chaos is real:
- Outdated files pile up
- Conflicting docs multiply
- Markdown sprawl everywhere
- File creation context is lost

Timepon brings visibility to file creation patterns, helping you maintain development hygiene in AI-assisted workflows.

## Available Tools

Once configured, your AI can use:

| Tool | Purpose | Example Question |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `get_all_files` | List all tracked files | "Show me all tracked files" |
| `get_files_by_tag` | Filter by tag | "Show me all markdown files" |
| `get_recent_files` | Filter by time | "What was created in the last hour?" |
| `search_files` | Text search | "Find schema-related files" |
| `refresh_metadata` | Force rescan | "Refresh file tracking" |

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **Cursor IDE**
- **Windows** (PowerShell for setup scripts)

## Philosophy

Development with AI is different. Traditional file organisation breaks down when you're generating dozens of files per session. Timepon adapts to this new reality by making file creation patterns visible and queryable.

The tool emerged from recognising that AI-assisted development creates its own unique challenges around documentation hygiene and file organisation. Rather than fighting the AI's tendency to create files, we embrace it and add visibility.

## Contributing

This is a personal tool built for a specific workflow. That said, if you find bugs or have suggestions:

1. Ensure you can reproduce the issue
2. Check the troubleshooting guide first
3. Review the technical documentation
4. Open an issue with clear reproduction steps
